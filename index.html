      <h2>About Maitree</h2>
      <p>
        Maitree (মৈত্রী), which translates to "friendliness" or "amity" in Bengali, is a non-profit community dedicated to fostering 
        open-source research and development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our primary focus lies in the Bengali 
        language, aiming to empower researchers, developers, and enthusiasts by providing resources, tools, and collaboration 
        opportunities. We strive to advance the state of Bengali NLP (Natural Language Processing) and AI as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Maitree's spirit of collaboration extends beyond the Bengali language. We actively encourage and welcome contributions 
        from individuals interested in other languages and areas of AI research. Our goal is to build a diverse and inclusive community 
        that fosters innovation across the entire spectrum of AI development.
